# Selection Sort Algorithm Visualization

This interactive repository showcases the Selection Sort algorithm using JavaScript and HTML. Witness how an array is sorted **visually** in ascending order, with each step clearly represented.

**What is Selection Sort?**

Selection Sort is a fundamental comparison-based sorting technique. It repeatedly searches through the unsorted portion of an array, finding the **minimum element** and swapping it with the element at the **beginning** of that unsorted section. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

**Key Points:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) in all cases - The number of comparisons and swaps grows quadratically with the input size (n). This means larger arrays take more time to sort using Selection Sort.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Selection Sort is an **in-place** sorting algorithm, meaning it modifies the original array without requiring significant additional data structures.
